# Relativity Visualizer

An interactive visualization tool for exploring concepts from Einstein's theory of relativity.

## Features

- **Spacetime Curvature**: Visualize how mass warps spacetime
- **Particle Geodesics**: See how particles move along curved spacetime
- **Gravitational Waves**: Explore how binary systems emit gravitational waves
- **Observer View**: Experience different reference frames in relativity
- **Extreme Objects**: Visualize black holes, neutron stars, and mergers
- **Singularity Debate**: Learn about scientific debates in relativity theory

## Technologies Used

- React
- D3.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React (for icons)

## Getting Started

```bash
